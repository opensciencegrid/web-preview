                    Researchers harnassing the capacity of the OSPool are racking up record-breaking numbers. On June 8, the OSPool, which provides computing resources to researchers across the country, went over 1.1 million core hours –– a daily record number. To put this in perspective, one million core hours is equivalent to using 42 thousand cores in just one day. That is close to half the size of some large supercomputing centers. In short, an increasing number of researchers are utilizing the OSG to carry out an incredible amount of computing.

                    The OSG consortium is nearing the completion of migrating its software stack to the WebDAV data transfer protocol - a widely used, industry-compatible and secure protocol. The WebDAV protocol which is an extension of the well-known HTTP allows Third-Party-Copy transfers which are commonly used to move bulk data between storage systems worldwide. Moreover, WebDav is compatible with the OAuth2 mechanism for authentication.

                    Since its beginning, our universe has been expanding. The early work of scientists
such as Edwin Hubble gave us proof that galaxies across the universe are moving apart
from one another. Hubble’s law states, “Objects observed in deep space are found to
have a red shift, interpreted as a relative velocity away from Earth.”  The
Dark Energy Survey (DES) seeks to help unravel
the mysteries of what forces are causing this expansion by focusing on dark energy
and how it constantly remaps the cosmos.

There were 56 participants, including mostly graduate students, post-doctoral researchers,
a few advanced undergraduates, several faculty, and some research staff from research
institutions in the United States (and one each from England and Spain). The range of
scholarly domains was one of the most diverse yet, including physics, biology, chemistry,
medicine, engineering, statistics, earth sciences, plant sciences, and economics. Participants
were selected by demonstrating need for large-scale computing and by being in a position
to transform their scholarly work through computation. The instructors this year were Bala
Desinghu, Brian Lin, and Derek Weitzel from the OSG, plus Christina Koch and Lauren Michael
from the UW–Madison’s Center for High Throughput Computing.

Both LIGO detectors, one in Hanford, Washington, and one in Livingston, Louisiana, observed a gravitational wave from the merger of two black holes, and with that, the final piece of Einstein’s general theory of relativity fell into place.

Computation has extended what researchers can investigate in chemistry, biology, and material science. Studying complex systems like proteins or nanocomposites can use similar techniques for common challenges. For example, computational power is expanding the horizons of protein research and opening up vast new possibilities for drug discovery and disease treatment.

                    Whether exploring how the brain is fooled by fake news or explaining the decline of knowledge in dementia, cognitive neuroscientists like Chris Cox are relying more on high-throughput computing resources like the Open Science Pool to understand how the brain makes sense of information.

                    Scott Cole, a neuroscience PhD student at University of California San Diego, wrote an article which appeared in PythonWeekly that details how to get up and running on Open Science Pool.  “I was starting to run into computational limitations in my neuroscience research, but I didn’t have any experience speeding up my work with something like high throughput computing,” said Cole.  When Cole saw that there was an opportunity at the OSG User School to learn how to use OSG and the free access to resources it provides, he jumped on it.

                    Albert Einstein first posed the idea of gravitational waves in his general theory of relativity just over a century ago. But until now, they had never been observed directly. For the first time, scientists with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration (LSC) have observed ripples in the fabric of spacetime called gravitational waves.
